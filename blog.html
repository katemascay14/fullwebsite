                    <p>Fried dough confectionery or dessert food. The doughnut is popular in many countries and prepared in various forms as a sweet snack that can be homemade or purchased in bakeries, supermarkets, food stalls, and franchised specialty outlets.</p>
                    <p>"This recipe is very quick and easy to make. I have a donut pan, which is like a muffin pan, but has donut shaped holes rather than muffin shaped holes. These donuts are baked not fried, so they don't have so many calories. I mix up either a powdered sugar glaze or a chocolate icing to top these with. They can also be rolled in cinnamon and white sugar, but it doesn't stick very well. My husband likes them just plain. For a chocolate glaze, simply stir 1/2 cup melted chocolate chips into the glaze mixture."</p>

                    <p>"This is a recipe that my family has created for a portable breakfast. It uses a bread machine for the dough preparation. The filling can be with a variety of things. We like the sausage, cheese, and hash browns for a breakfast meal. I prepare the recipe by filling the kolaches the night before, and keeping them in the refrigerator overnight. In the morning, I set out the kolaches to warm to room temperature while the oven is preheating, and then cook them for a quick, hot breakfast."</p>
